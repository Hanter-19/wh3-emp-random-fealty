Many thanks to the folks at [Da Modding Den](https://discord.gg/moddingden) whose numerous resources helped me learn how to make WH3 mods.

Special thanks to [freakpear](https://steamcommunity.com/id/freakpear/myworkshopfiles/?appid=1142710) whose tips helped me get started on modding for WH3, and whose Empire Overhaul mod [Your New Empire](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2894759552) and [recommended Mod collection](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2880941519) inspired me to start a new heavily modded Empire campaign. This led me to finally start making my own mods.
